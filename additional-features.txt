Here are valuable features you can add to further enhance your Playwright test suite:

1. __Test Coverage Reporting__: Integrate code coverage tools (e.g., Playwright's built-in coverage with Istanbul/nyc) to measure and publish code coverage for each run.
2. __Advanced Reporting__: Add Allure, Playwright HTML reports, or integrate additional dashboards for more actionable insights on test results.
3. __Parallel Execution & Matrix Builds__: Run tests in parallel across different browsers and OS versions via GitHub Actions build matrix for improved speed and cross-compatibility.
4. __Visual Regression Testing__: Capture and compare screenshots to detect unintended UI changes using Playwright’s snapshot feature or plugins.
5. __Accessibility Checks (a11y)__: Integrate tools like axe-core or @playwright/experimental-ct-axe to automatically detect accessibility issues.
6. __API Testing__: Extend the suite to include API endpoint validation and error-case testing.
7. __Continuous Feedback__: Add notifications via Slack, Teams, or email for build and test failures or test result summaries.
8. __Test Tagging & Filtering__: Use Playwright’s test annotations (e.g. @smoke, @regression) for targeted regression, smoke, or feature-specific runs.
9. __Data-Driven & Parameterized Testing__: Add test parameterization for broader and more robust scenario coverage.
10. __Test Flake Detection and Handling__: Track flaky tests, enable retries, and automate flakiness reporting.
11. __Performance/Network Profiling__: Add scenarios with throttled network speed, performance assertions and page metric collection.
12. __Network Request Mocking/Intercepts__: Increase test reliability and broaden error coverage by mocking backends or triggering error states.
13. __Test Artifacts Archival__: Automatically save and archive run artifacts (screenshots, videos, logs) for every CI run.
14. __Third-Party Integration__: Push results into test management or defect tracking tools like Jira, TestRail, or Zephyr.
15. __Automatic PR Validation__: Ensure all PRs (not just merges) trigger the suite.
